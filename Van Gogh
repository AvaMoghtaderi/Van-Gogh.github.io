        <h2>A Famous painter</h2>
        <h3>Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created approximately 2100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold, symbolic colours, and dramatic, impulsive and highly expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Only one of his paintings was known by name to have been sold during his lifetime. Van Gogh became famous after his suicide at age 37, which followed years of poverty and mental illness.</h3><hr>
        <h2>Life</h2>
        <h3>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife, Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh family. The name had been borne by his grandfather, the prominent art dealer Vincent (1789–1874), and a theology graduate at the University of Leiden in 1811. This Vincent had six sons, three of whom became art dealers, and may have been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor(1729–1802).</h3><hr>
        <h2>His Paintings</h2>
        <h3>The Starry Night</h3>
        <img src="a.jpg" alt="The Starry Night">
        <h4>The Starry Night (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus, The Starry Night is one of the most recognizable paintings in Western art.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Sun Flowers</h3>
        <img src="R.jpg" alt="sun flowers" width="384" height="461">
        <h4>Sunflowers (original title, in French: Tournesols) is the title of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, made a year later in Arles, shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind, both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later, Van Gogh hoped to welcome and impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay.</h4><hr>
        <h3>The Potato Eaters</h3>
        <img src="t.jpg" alt="the potato easters" width="375" height="264">
        <h4>The Potato Eaters (Dutch: De Aardappeleters) is an oil painting by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh painted in April 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands. It is in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. The original oil sketch is at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, and he made lithographs of the image, which are held in collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting is considered to be one of Van Gogh's masterpieces.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Cafe Terrace at Night</h3>
        <img src="w.jpg" alt="cafe terrace at night" width="237" height="300">
        <h4>Café Terrace at Night is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It is also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening (Café, le soir).Van Gogh painted Café Terrace at Night in Arles, France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters.Visitors to the site can stand at the north eastern corner of the Place du Forum, where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now Musée Lapidaire.Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop and some branches of the trees surrounding the place, but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop.The painting is currently at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Bridges across the Seine at Asnieres</h3>
        <img src="d.jpg" alt="Bridges across the Seine at Asnieres" width="324" height="254">
        <h4>Bridges across the Seine at Asnières (F301) was painted in open air and bright sunlight. The scene depicts railway bridges over the river. Van Gogh uses light and reflection effectively in this painting. The stone piers of the bridge are reflected in the water and white paint is used for highlights. A woman dressed in pink with a red parasol are the focal point of the composition. The painting is part of a group of suburban landscapes along with a painting in Oxford, both of which he had placed in red frames. Van Gogh found this setting through his friend Émile Bernard whom he met when studying with Cormon. Over the two years that Van Gogh was in Paris [1886—1887] Van Gogh made several paintings of bridges crossing the Seine.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Wheatfield with Crows</h3>
        <img src="Wheatfield-with-Crows.jpg.webp" alt="Wheatfield-with-Crows" width="400" height="192">
        <h4>Wheatfield with Crows is an extended canvas painting that displays a dramatic foggy sky packed with crows above a wheat field. Two-thirds of the canvas is taken up by a wind-swept wheat field. The spectator is drawn into the picture by an empty route. Van Gogh is reported to have painted Wheatfield with Crows in July 1890. Although it is not as commonly known to the general public, it is considered one of his best works.It is widely assumed that this was van Gogh’s last work. However, since no definite historical records exist, art historians are unsure whether which work was van Gogh’s final. At the time van Gogh has painted several works on double-squared canvases the other two being Wheatfield Under Thunderclouds and Daubigny’s Garden(which he would paint three times). These are all examples of van Gogh’s extended double-square canvases, which he utilized solely in the final few weeks of his life, in June and July of 1890.Wheatfield under Clouded Sky, like this piece, is in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.Wheatfield with Crows, along with 19 other Van Gogh paintings, was stolen and soon recovered in 1991. The criminals “severely damaged” the artwork during the robbery.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Van-Gogh Self Portrait</h3>
        <img src="Van-Gogh-Self-Portrait-1889.jpg.webp" alt="Van-Gogh-Self-Portrait" width="246.5" height="299.5">
        <h4>In September 1889, Van Gogh painted a self-portrait in oil on canvas. The painting, which may be Van Gogh’s last self-portrait, was completed soon before he departed Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in southern France. In the span of 10 years, Van Gogh created 36 self-portraits making him one of the most prolific famous self-portrait artists. More so than the vast majority of other well-known artists. The self-portrait was a crucial study of personal fulfillment and artistic accomplishment for many artists, including Van Gogh. He is believed to have painted himself since he often lacked the funds to hire models. The flowing backdrop filled with broad swirling brushstrokes, in contrast to his fixed, almost stiff countenance, creates an intriguing juxtaposition.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Starry Night Over the Rhône</h3>
        <img src="g.jpg" alt="Starry Night Over the Rhône" width="387" height="300">
        <h4>Starry Night (September 1888, French: La Nuit étoilée), commonly known as Starry Night Over the Rhône, is one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings of Arles at night. It was painted on the bank of the Rhône that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine, which van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of van Gogh's more famous paintings, including Café Terrace at Night (painted earlier the same month) and the June, 1889, canvas from Saint-Remy, The Starry Night. A sketch of the painting is included in a letter van Gogh sent to his friend Eugène Boch on 2 October 1888. Starry Night, which is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was first exhibited in 1889 at Paris' annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. It was shown together with van Gogh's Irises, which was added by Vincent's brother, Theo, although Vincent had proposed including one of his paintings from the public gardens in Arles.</h4><hr>
        <h3>Irises</h3>
        <img src="b.jpg" alt="Irises" width="408.5" height="349.5" >
        <h4>Irises is one of several paintings of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, and one of a series of paintings he made at the Saint Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, in the last year before his death in 1890.Van Gogh started painting Irises within a month of entering the asylum, in May 1889, working from nature in the hospital garden. There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works. He called painting "the lightning conductor for my illness" because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint.</h4><hr>
